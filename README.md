# Readme

- This is a fork of https://kylelogue.github.io/mustard-ui
- The original package.json throws a node-sass error since it's not updated
- The current package.json works for me in 2023
- I've updated some of the config in gulpfile and package.json so it doesn't throw errors on build
- I use this project as a base UI framework for simple / micro websites due it's simplicity,clarity, user friendliness, and general ease of use

## Serving with gulp
